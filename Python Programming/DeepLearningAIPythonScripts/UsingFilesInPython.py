# ========================================
# 1. Import Required Functions
# ========================================
from helper_functions import get_llm_response
from IPython.display import display, Markdown

# ========================================
# 2. Load Email Text from File
# ========================================
f = open("email.txt", "r")
email = f.read()
f.close()

# ========================================
# 3. Create LLM Prompt from Email Content

prompt = f"""Extract bullet points from the following email. 
Include the sender information. 

Email:
{email}"""

print(prompt) #Print the Prompt (Optional for Debugging)

# Output snippet:
# Extract bullet points from the following email.
# Include the sender information.
# Email:
# Subject: My Incredible Journey Around the World!
# Hi Andrew,
# I hope you are doing great! I just returned from an incredible trip...

# ========================================
# 5. Get LLM Response with Bullet Points
# ========================================
bullet_points = get_llm_response(prompt)

# ========================================
# 6. Print Bullet Points (Text Output)
# ========================================
bullet_points = get_llm_response(prompt)
print(bullet_points)
# Output snippet:
# - **Sender:** Daniel
# - **Subject:** My Incredible Journey Around the World!
# - **Trip Highlights:**
#   - New York: Broadway show and skyline
#   - Rio de Janeiro: Copacabana Beach...
#   - Cape Town: Natural beauty and safari adventures
#   ...
# - **Future Plans:** Share more stories and photos when catching up with Andrew.

# ========================================
# 7. Render Bullet Points in Markdown Format
# (Only works in Jupyter or environments that support display)
# ========================================
# Print in Markdown format
display(Markdown(bullet_points))
# Output snippet (rendered nicely in Markdown view):
# Sender: Daniel
# Subject: My Incredible Journey Around the World!
# Trip Highlights:
# - New York: Broadway show and skyline
# - Rio de Janeiro: Copacabana Beach...
# - Cape Town: Natural beauty and safari adventures
